        "about": "Hi and welcome C I am a professional digital artist with years of experience and I would love to help you out with your AI-generated art. I can edit any style as I am good with copying art styles--my job literally requires it. Eyes, ears, hands, fingers, noses--all facial features and human anatomy are not an issue. But I wont limit you with humans only. I know how to paint animals and therefore how to fix possible AI flaws. Aside from characters, I am able to fix or improve backgrounds that you can possibly use for game art, including both nature and architecture+perspective. Let's make objects on your A.I. images make sense together! Prices are per one image and starting price is $5 for very simple fixes! Please contact me privately beforehand! I will need to see the AI picture that you want me to edit first, thats the starting point. Also, I can make a cover for you, based on your image. Fiction, music, book--you pick. Let’s discuss it if you are interested!",
